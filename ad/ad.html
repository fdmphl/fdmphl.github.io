ISO Cat Sanctuary or Barn Cat arrangement for two feral cats.<br/>
<br/>
Hi folks - These two feral boys are the last remaining from a local colony that I and some neighbors cleaned up with a TNR spree some years back. Over time all other cats have gone, and so have the helpful neighbors. Alas soon I'll also be moving from the area, and circumstances are such that I can't bring them with me. I'd like to ensure these fine fellows are well cared for before I depart. The important points:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Feral since showing up as ~1 year old cats, TNR'ed at that time, about 5-6 years ago. I've been ensuring they're well fed ever since.<br/><br/></li>
<li>In good health as of their last vet visit, which was a couple years ago courtesy of one of said helpful neighbors. Current appearance and behavior suggest this is unchanged.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Somewhat well behaved, but are not adoptable. They still hiss and back up if I get too close, and did not take well to being indoors, despite multiple serious efforts to socialize them a while back.<br/><br/></li>
<li>Not really youngsters anymore, but dang they sure do still enjoy chasing mice and birds!<br/><br/></li>
<li>They are BFFs, so it would be best for their transition to new digs if they can go together.</li>
</ul>
I think they would make excellent barn cats - they strongly prefer the outdoors, and the company of other cats, but not humans (although they tolerate me somewhat given the familiarity). I really don't want to take them to a shelter given their temperament and what that likely means for their prospects...<br/><br/>
I can conceivably arrange transport to locations in Philly or sounding areas in PA, NJ, NY and CT as I am through these areas frequently. Would be interesting to trap them again. Hmmm does anyone have some military grade body armor I can borrow? ?? (kidding... mostly...)<br/>
